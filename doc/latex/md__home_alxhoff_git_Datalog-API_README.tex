\subsection*{Introduction}

The original implementation of the L\+U\+A/C library is not the easiest to work with and does not lead to logical or easy to follow code. I have quickly thrown this A\+PI together to make the coding datalog coding style similar to that of the Python implementation.

\subsection*{Prerequisites}

The L\+U\+A/C library can be found \href{http://datalog.sourceforge.net}{\tt here} and must be downlaoded and placed into the libs folder such that the file tree looks like this 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 |--- Datalog-API  
2       |  
3       |---bin  
4       |---build  
5       |---doc  
6       |  
7       |---libs  
8            |---libdatalog <---rename downloaded folder to this  
9                |---source files  
10                |---lua  
11                     |---lua source files  
\end{DoxyCode}
 \subsection*{Building}

I have included a demo \hyperlink{main_8c}{main.\+c} as well as a demo C\+Make that will build the A\+PI as a shared library that can then be linked into an exsisting project.

\subsubsection*{How to build}

It\textquotesingle{}s pretty tough.... cd into the root director and create a build dir, or don\textquotesingle{}t, it\textquotesingle{}ll be your mess.


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 cd Datalog-API
2 mkdir build
3 cd build
\end{DoxyCode}
 Generate C\+Make junk {\bfseries or} run ccmake to configure debugging options 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 cmake ..
\end{DoxyCode}
 {\bfseries or} 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 ccmake ..
\end{DoxyCode}
 and finally make 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 make
\end{DoxyCode}
 The executable can be found in the bin subdirectory in the root dir.

Library objects in the build subdirectory.

\subsection*{Documentation}

To generate the documentation run the command


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 doxygen
\end{DoxyCode}
 from the doc folder. Then navigate to ./html/index.html

\subsection*{Work in progress}

I wrote this quickly and dirtily, so excuse the mess.

\subsubsection*{To-\/\+Do}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item $\sim$$\sim$\+Clauses with bodies$\sim$$\sim$
\item Error checking on literal types
\item Check that all methods are implemented for all objects, both with and without structs.
\item Lots more stuff I am to yet to discover
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Objects}

The A\+PI revolves around a struct objects to enable a more logical way or representing datalog commands rather than the push and pop confusion found in the library.

Literals are represented by the object {\bfseries datalog\+\_\+literal\+\_\+t}, queries by {\bfseries datalog\+\_\+query\+\_\+t} and clauses by {\bfseries datalog\+\_\+clause\+\_\+t}. I may of missed a few methods to be implemented but I should get these done as I actually use this A\+PI for other code.
