The original implementation of the L\+U\+A/C library is not the easiest to work with and does not lead to logical or easy to follow code. I have quickly thrown this A\+PI together to make the coding datalog coding style similar to that of the Python implementation.  prereq\+\_\+sec Prerequisites The L\+U\+A/C library can be found here \href{http://datalog.sourceforge.net}{\tt http\+://datalog.\+sourceforge.\+net} and must be downlaoded and placed into the libs folder such that the file tree looks like this ~\newline

 \hypertarget{index_building_sec}{}\section{Building}\label{index_building_sec}
I have included a demo \hyperlink{main_8c}{main.\+c} as well as a demo C\+Make that will build the A\+PI as a shared library that can then be linked into a exsisting project.~\newline
 \hypertarget{index_build_cmds}{}\subsection{How to build}\label{index_build_cmds}
It\textquotesingle{}s pretty tough.... cd into the root director and create a build dir, or don\textquotesingle{}t, it\textquotesingle{}ll be your mess. \begin{DoxyVerb} cd Datalog-API
 mkdir build
 cd build\end{DoxyVerb}
 Generate C\+Make junk \begin{DoxyVerb} cmake ..\end{DoxyVerb}
 and finally make \begin{DoxyVerb} make\end{DoxyVerb}
 The executable can be found in the bin subdirectory in the root dir. ~\newline

 Library objects in the build subdirectory. \hypertarget{index_progress_sec}{}\section{Work in progress}\label{index_progress_sec}
I wrote this quickly and dirtily, so excuse the mess. \hypertarget{index_todo_sec}{}\subsection{To-\/\+Do}\label{index_todo_sec}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Clauses with bodies
\item Error checking on literal types
\item Check that all methods are implemented for all objects, both with and without structs. 
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_objects_sec}{}\section{Objects}\label{index_objects_sec}
The A\+PI revolves around a struct objects to enable a more logical way or representing datalog commands rather than the push and pop confusion found in the library. ~\newline
~\newline
 Literals are represented by the object datalog\+\_\+literal\+\_\+t, queries by datalog\+\_\+query\+\_\+t and clauses by datalog\+\_\+clause\+\_\+t. ~\newline
~\newline
 I may of missed a few methods to be implemented but I should get these done as I actually use this A\+PI for other code.
