\#\+Datalog A\+PI

\subsection*{Introduction}

The original implementation of the L\+U\+A/C library is not the easiest to work with and does not lead to logical or easy to follow code. I have quickly thrown this A\+PI together to make the coding datalog coding style similar to that of the Python implementation.

\subsection*{Prerequisites}

The L\+U\+A/C library can be found here \href{http://datalog.sourceforge.net}{\tt http\+://datalog.\+sourceforge.\+net} and must be downlaoded and placed into the libs folder such that the file tree looks like this

$\vert$--- Datalog-\/\+A\+PI $\vert$ $\vert$---bin $\vert$---build $\vert$---doc $\vert$ $\vert$---libs $\vert$---libdatalog $<$---rename downloaded folder to this $\vert$---source files $\vert$---lua $\vert$---lua source files

\subsection*{Building}

I have included a demo \hyperlink{main_8c}{main.\+c} as well as a demo C\+Make that will build the A\+PI as a shared library that can then be linked into a exsisting project.

\subsubsection*{How to build}

It\textquotesingle{}s pretty tough.... cd into the root director and create a build dir, or don\textquotesingle{}t, it\textquotesingle{}ll be your mess.


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 cd Datalog-API
2 mkdir build
3 cd build
\end{DoxyCode}
 Generate C\+Make junk 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 cmake ..
\end{DoxyCode}
 and finally make 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 make
\end{DoxyCode}
 The executable can be found in the bin subdirectory in the root dir.

Library objects in the build subdirectory.

\subsection*{Work in progress}

I wrote this quickly and dirtily, so excuse the mess.

\subsubsection*{To-\/\+Do}

$\ast$\+Clauses with bodies $\ast$\+Error checking on literal types $\ast$\+Check that all methods are implemented for all objects, both with and without structs.

\subsection*{Objects}

The A\+PI revolves around a struct objects to enable a more logical way or representing datalog commands rather than the push and pop confusion found in the library.

Literals are represented by the object datalog\+\_\+literal\+\_\+t, queries by datalog\+\_\+query\+\_\+t and clauses by datalog\+\_\+clause\+\_\+t. I may of missed a few methods to be implemented but I should get these done as I actually use this A\+PI for other code.
